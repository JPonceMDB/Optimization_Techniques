# Optimization_Techniques
Approaching the linear and logistic regression using optimization techniques.

In this study we are going to explain the basis of optimization techniques for two models: the linear regression model and the logistic regression model. For both of these we will cover the implementation of the models in R, after that we will compute the models to show the numeric results. Finally, we will make a result comparison between the model made from scratch in contrast with the results obtained using the R build-in funcions, such as lm (for linear regression) and glm(for logistic regression).
